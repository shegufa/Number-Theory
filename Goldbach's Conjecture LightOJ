Idea for solution:
First, create a sieve of Eratosthenes for n=10^7 which will tell us whether a number(within 10^7) is prime or not, also create an array of primes (say the name of this array is 
prime[]) from this.
Second, just check for any input n, for the prime numbers which are less than or equal to n/2, whether n minus that_prime_number is also a prime or not, if it's a prime, count
that, else ignore.
This loop looks like this:

    int c=0,i;

    for(i=1;prime[i]<=n/2;i++)
    {
        if(num[n-prime[i]]==0) c++;
    }
   
 c is the answer.
