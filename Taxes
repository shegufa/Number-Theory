Idea for solution:

From Goldbach's Conjecture[GC], we know that, an even number greater than 2 can be expressed as a sum of two primes, this is oroved true using computer upto 1.6*10^18.
(https://github.com/shegufa/Number-Theory/blob/main/Goldbach's%20Conjecture)

We use this idea for the solution of this problem as the constraint for n in the problem (2*10^9) is less than 1.6*10^18.

If we study the problem, we can say that if the number n can be expressed as sums of minimum number of primes, then he has to 
pay the lowest tax. 
Such as, if n=8 and it's expressed as 3+5, then he has to pay 1  burle for each part, hence 2 burles.

So, we can construct our algorithm like this: 2 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^9

* if n is a prime number itself, answer=1
* else [n is not a prime number]
  => n is even , answer = 2 [from GC]
  => n is odd [ the answer is not 1 as it is not a prime, n can be expressed as 2+n-2 or 3+n-3
     => the answer would be 2 if n-2 is prime, because then, n can be expressed as a sum of two prime numbers 2 + (n-2).
     
        but if n-2 is not a prime, then it will be more than 2 for sure, can be 3 or more. we cannot decide anything from here at once. But we know from here, the lowest possible
        tax in this scenario is 3.
        
     => else if n-2 is not a prime, we can express n as 3 + (n-3); as n is odd, n-3 is even.
       and from GC, we know n-3 can be expressed as sum of two prime numbers (say n-3 = p1+p2, where p1, p2 are two prime numbers)
       So, n can be rewritten as 3+ p1+p2, hence the tax will be 3. And we can decide that this is the lowest tax possible for this case.
       
This is it.
The code for this part looks like this: [say, isPrime(n) is a function which returns 1 if n is a prime number, 0 if it's not]

    if(isPrime(n)==1) ans=1;
    else
        {
            if(n%2==0)
            {
                ans= 2;
            }
            else //odd
            {
               if(isPrime(n-2)==1) ans = 2;
               else ans=3;
            }
        }

ans is the answer.
