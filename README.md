# Number Theory

This repository will contain few number thoery related problems and ideas, hopefully. 
The problems can be from any of the programming websites. Or it can be from nowhere - it can be just an explanation or implementation of an idea; related to number theory of course.
* If you find few files with similar names, The text file among them should contain problem links(if any), idea of solution etc. The cpp file among them will contain the source code of my solution.
* And if you just find a cpp file, open it, click its description (the three dots beside its name), you should find a problem link.
* If it's an implementation of well known algorithms like "Sieve of Eratosthenes.cpp" , then it's just an implementation, you might not find any link. We can use that code in other problems.

May Allah bless you with goodness. :)
