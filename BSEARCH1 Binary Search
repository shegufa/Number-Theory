This can be solved very easily with few basic STL functions.

For learning binary_search STL function, you can visit https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-functions-in-c-stl-binary_search-lower_bound-and-upper_bound/

My one solution for the problem is uploaded in the same repository with the name "BSEARCH1 Binary Search.cpp"

In another solution I did not use any STL function. That solution is also in this repository with the name "BSEARCH1 Binary Search without STL.cpp"


**
If you use "cin, cout", it might cause few problems.

In this problem, using basic "scanf, printf" will be enough.  I prefer using scanf, printf everywhere. 

Thank you.
